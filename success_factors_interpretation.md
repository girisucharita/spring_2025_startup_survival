### status_acquired

Being acquired is one definition of success, so this feature may be directly related to the target variable in some models.

This measures how effectively a startup converts funding into growth or value. Startups that can achieve more with less funding demonstrate capital efficiency, which is attractive to investors.

### funding_age_ratio

This ratio of funding to company age indicates how quickly a company can raise capital relative to its lifespan. Higher values suggest strong investor confidence and momentum.

More comprehensive company descriptions may indicate better planning, clearer vision, and stronger communication skills, which are important for attracting investors and customers.

### relationships

The number of business relationships (partnerships, collaborations, etc.) reflects a startup's ability to build a network, which can provide resources, customers, and growth opportunities.

### relationship_density
