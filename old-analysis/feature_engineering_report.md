## Rationale and Expected Impact

The engineered features aim to capture various dimensions that might predict startup success:

1. **Speed and Efficiency**: Features like days_to_first_funding, funding_per_year, and milestone_frequency capture how quickly a company can achieve important milestones.

2. **Location Advantage**: Geographic features identify companies in established tech ecosystems that might benefit from network effects, talent pools, and investor proximity.

3. **Industry Trends**: Category-based features help identify which sectors have higher success rates.

4. **Network Effects**: Relationship-based features capture the company's connections, which can be crucial for partnerships, hiring, and fundraising.

5. **Communication Quality**: Text-based features may indicate how well a company can articulate its value proposition.

6. **Funding Patterns**: Financial features capture not just the amount of funding but patterns that might indicate investor confidence.

7. **Composite Indicators**: Interaction features capture complex relationships between multiple factors that might collectively influence success.

These engineered features significantly expand the predictive power of the dataset by transforming raw data into meaningful indicators that align with business intuition about startup success factors.
