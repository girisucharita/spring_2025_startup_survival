# Startup Success Analysis: Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of factors that contribute to startup success, based on data from the Crunchbase database. Using machine learning techniques, we have identified the key predictors of startup success and developed actionable recommendations for entrepreneurs, investors, and ecosystem builders.

## Methodology

Our analysis employed a Gradient Boosting Classifier model to predict startup success based on a wide range of features. Success was defined using a composite metric that considered:

- Acquisition status (whether the company was acquired)
- IPO status (whether the company went public)
- Funding levels (total funding received)
- Return on investment (when available)

The model was trained on a dataset of over 190,000 companies and achieved high accuracy in predicting success outcomes.
