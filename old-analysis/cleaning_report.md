# Data Cleaning Report for Crunchbase Companies Dataset

## Overview
This report documents the data cleaning process applied to the Crunchbase companies dataset for the startup success prediction project.

## Dataset Information
- **Original Dataset**: 196553 rows, 52 columns
- **Cleaned Dataset**: 196553 rows, 44 columns
- **Rows Removed**: 0
- **Columns Removed**: 8

## Cleaning Steps Performed

### 1. Duplicate Handling
- Checked for duplicate rows: 0 found and removed
- Checked for duplicate company IDs: 0 found

### 2. Column Removal
The following columns were removed:
- **High Missing Value Columns** (>95% missing): parent_id, closed_at, short_description, first_investment_at, last_investment_at, investment_rounds, invested_companies, ROI
- **Redundant Columns**: Unnamed: 0.1
- **Limited Analytical Value Columns**: logo_url, logo_width, logo_height, parent_id

### 3. Missing Value Treatment
- **Categorical Columns**: Filled with 'unknown' (entity_type, status, category_code, country_code, state_code, region, success_class)
- **Text Columns**: Filled with empty string (name, normalized_name, domain, homepage_url, twitter_username, short_description, description, overview, tag_list)
- **Numeric Funding Columns**: Filled with 0 (funding_rounds, funding_total_usd)
- **Date Columns**: Kept as NaN to avoid introducing bias (founded_at, closed_at, first_investment_at, last_investment_at, first_funding_at, last_funding_at, first_milestone_at, last_milestone_at)

### 4. Text Standardization
- Cleaned and standardized text in: name, normalized_name, short_description, description, overview
- Standardized URLs in: homepage_url, domain

### 5. Geographic Data Standardization
- Converted country codes to uppercase
- Converted state codes to uppercase
- Validated latitude/longitude values

### 6. Data Type Correction
- Converted numeric columns to appropriate numeric types
- Converted categorical columns to category type

### 7. Data Quality Flags
- **Companies with Complete Core Info**: 196553 (100.00%)
- **Companies with Location Info**: 196553 (100.00%)
- **Companies with Funding Info**: 196553 (100.00%)
- **Companies with Founding Date**: 91227 (46.41%)

### 8. Outlier Handling
- **funding_total_usd**: 27874 outliers detected
- **funding_rounds**: 31707 outliers detected
- **relationships**: 12366 outliers detected
- **age_years**: 6009 outliers detected
- Capped 197 extreme funding values at 222202464.00

## Impact on Analysis
The cleaning process has:
1. Removed redundant and low-value columns to focus the analysis
2. Handled missing values appropriately based on column context
3. Standardized text and geographic data for consistency
4. Added data quality flags to help filter companies for analysis
5. Addressed outliers in key numeric columns

## Next Steps
The cleaned dataset is now ready for feature engineering, where we will:
1. Create derived features from existing data
2. Extract insights from text fields
3. Develop time-based metrics
4. Prepare the data for modeling
